# Immature Greeting Generator

## When picking your child up from school do you ever struggle to respond to your childs immature and silly words?

### Well, struggle no longer. Simply run this code for a preloaded greeting that will make you a hit at the playground.

There are a number of subcategorised arrays nested inside of the immatureChoices object.

I created a generateRandomNumber helper function which I then call within 3 separate for...in loops to iterate through the arrays to push the relevant strings to 3 different empty 'Greeting' strings to create 3 greeting options based on gender.

I learnt how to skip through cases in switch statements by not adding a condition & just going straight to break. This helped to skip through the male or female pronouns arrays in the relevant gendered greetings.

These strings are joined and printed using a formatting function within the immatureGreeting function. 
Each greeting string variable is called through the immatureGreeting function.

_I could keep thinking of & adding to the arrays but I'd never end up uploading it. It is very fun._

***Version1 file included for reference. 
This is my original version of the program before I branched out to edit it into the script.js as I have it now. 
The original version worked but I felt that it was a bit convoluted so I wanted simplify and increase functionality which I feel that I have achieved.
I just wanted to include to preserve and display my process.***
